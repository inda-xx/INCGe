# Solution

Here's a comprehensive solution for the task, complete with code, logic explanation, and time complexity analysis.

### Solution

We'll implement this solution in Python, utilizing NumPy for data handling and Matplotlib for visualization.

##### Step 1: Simulating Data Loading

To simulate loading data, we'll initialize a 2D array with random temperature values ranging from -10 to 40 degrees Celsius.

```python
import numpy as np

# Simulate a 365 x 24 array for daily hourly temperatures
np.random.seed(0)  # For reproducibility
temperature_data = np.random.randint(-10, 41, (365, 24))
```

##### Step 2: Calculate Average Daily Temperature

We compute the average temperature for each day using NumPy's mean function, which operates efficiently on arrays.

```python
def calculate_average_daily_temperature(data):
    daily_avg_tmp = np.mean(data, axis=1)
    return daily_avg_tmp

average_daily_temperatures = calculate_average_daily_temperature(temperature_data)
```

##### Step 3: Identify Heatwaves

We'll traverse the array of daily averages and identify sequences where the average temperature exceeds 30 degrees Celsius for three or more consecutive days.

```python
def find_heatwaves(daily_averages):
    heatwaves = []
    current_wave = []
    
    for day in range(len(daily_averages)):
        if daily_averages[day] > 30:
            current_wave.append(day)
        else:
            if len(current_wave) >= 3:
                heatwaves.append(current_wave)
            current_wave = []

    # Catch any outstanding heatwave at the end of the loop
    if len(current_wave) >= 3:
        heatwaves.append(current_wave)
    
    return heatwaves

heatwaves = find_heatwaves(average_daily_temperatures)

# Print heatwave periods
for wave in heatwaves:
    start_day = wave[0]
    end_day = wave[-1]
    avg_temp = np.mean(average_daily_temperatures[start_day:end_day+1])
    print(f"Heatwave from day {start_day} to {end_day}, average: {avg_temp:.2f}°C")
```

##### Step 4: Visualize Temperature Trends

We will use matplotlib to plot a simple line graph which shows temperature trends across the year.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_temperature_trends(daily_averages):
    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
    plt.plot(daily_averages, label="Average Daily Temperature")
    plt.axhline(y=30, color='r', linestyle='--', label="Heatwave Threshold (30°C)")
    plt.xlabel('Day of the Year')
    plt.ylabel('Average Temperature (°C)')
    plt.title('Temperature Trends Over the Year')
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()

plot_temperature_trends(average_daily_temperatures)
```

##### Step 5: Optimization and Time Complexity

**Optimization Discussion**:
- Using NumPy's vectorized operations, we efficiently calculate daily averages and perform data manipulations.
- The solution uses a single pass to identify heatwaves, making it efficient for large-scale data.

**Time Complexity**:
- Calculating daily averages: O(nm) where n is the number of days and m is the number of hours per day (24).
- Identifying heatwaves involves traversing the list of daily averages once: O(n).
- Overall time complexity is dominated by the daily average calculation, hence: O(nm).

The very structure of NumPy and optimized NumPy functions allow significant efficiency gains over traditional nested loop constructs, presenting an ideal solution for large datasets in this task.

This solution covers all aspects of the task, ensuring clarity and efficiency throughout.
