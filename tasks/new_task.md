### Task Description

**Exercise 1: Advanced Data Analysis with Arrays**

**Subject**: Arrays  
**Difficulty**: Very Hard  
**Skills**: Loops  

**Learning Objectives**:  
- Deepen understanding of multidimensional arrays through manipulation and traversal.
- Develop complex algorithms using nested loops.
- Enhance problem-solving skills in the context of data analysis.

**Problem Statement**:

You are tasked with analyzing a large dataset represented as a two-dimensional array. Each element in the array represents the temperature (in degrees Celsius) recorded at various locations in a city at different times. The goal is to identify and analyze temperature trends to provide insights into potential heatwaves.

Develop a program that performs the following tasks:

1. **Data Loading**: Simulate loading data into a 2D array. For simplicity, you can randomly generate temperature values between -10 and 40 degrees Celsius. Assume the dataset is of size 365 (days) by 24 (hours).

2. **Calculate Average Daily Temperature**: Write a function that calculates the average temperature for each day and stores the results in a one-dimensional array.

3. **Identify Heatwaves**:
   - A heatwave is defined as any period of three or more consecutive days where the average temperature exceeds 30 degrees Celsius.
   - Analyze the one-dimensional array of daily average temperatures to identify all heatwave periods.
   - For each identified heatwave, print the start and end day, and the average temperature over the entire heatwave period.

4. **Visualize Temperature Trends**: Using the data, generate a simple line plot to visualize how temperature trends over the year. Use any programming language with visualization capabilities, such as Python with Matplotlib, to create this plot.

5. **Optimize for Efficiency**: Given the scale of data, optimize your loop structures to ensure minimal computational overhead. Discuss the time complexity of your solution.

**Assessment Criteria**:
- Correctness of algorithm in identifying heatwaves.
- Efficiency of loop constructs.
- Code readability and documentation.
- Quality and accuracy of visualizations.
- Explanation of time complexity and optimizations made.

Through this exercise, students are expected to engage deeply with advanced loop constructs in handling multidimensional data, typical of real-world data analysis challenges, enhancing both their algorithmic skills and understanding of data visualization.
