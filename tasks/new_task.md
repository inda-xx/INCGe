**Task Title: Implementing an Autocomplete System using Trie**

**Difficulty Level: Medium**

---

### Task Description

In this exercise, you will implement a Trie (pronounced as "try"), a specialized tree-like data structure, to design an autocomplete system. The Trie will be used to store a given dictionary of words. You'll then implement the functionality to suggest autocomplete options for a user's input prefix.

### Learning Objectives

- Understand and implement the Trie data structure.
- Apply knowledge of tree traversal algorithms.
- Utilize data structures for autocomplete functionality.
- Practice optimizing search operations for performance efficiency.

### Requirements

1. **Trie Structure Implementation:**
   - Define a `TrieNode` class or structure with the following:
     - A dictionary or hash map to store children nodes.
     - A boolean flag to indicate if the node is the last letter of a complete word.
   - Define a `Trie` class with the following methods:
     - `insert(word)`: Inserts a word into the Trie.
     - `search(word)`: Returns `True` if the word is in the Trie, `False` otherwise.
     - `startsWith(prefix)`: Returns `True` if there is any word in the Trie that starts with the given prefix.

2. **Autocomplete Feature:**
   - Implement a function `autocomplete(prefix)` that returns a list of all words in the Trie that start with the given prefix. Optimize for efficient retrieval.

3. **Test Cases:**
   - Insert the following words into your Trie: ['apple', 'app', 'apricot', 'bat', 'ball', 'cat']
   - Test the `autocomplete` function with input prefixes: 'ap', 'ba', 'c', and any other relevant cases you come up with.

### Additional Challenge (Optional)

- Extend the `autocomplete` function to return the top N suggestions based on the frequency of words. You can use additional data structures to track the frequency of each word, assuming it's provided.

### Submission

1. Your code file that implements the Trie and all required functionality.
2. A write-up not exceeding 500 words explaining:
   - The rationale and thought process for your implementation.
   - Challenges faced during the development.
   - Performance considerations and optimizations applied.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Correctness and completeness of the implementation.
- Code readability and organization.
- Efficiency and optimization strategies used.
- Thoroughness of test cases provided.

Good luck, and happy coding!
