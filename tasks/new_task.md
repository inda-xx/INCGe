**Subject: Analyze and Manipulate Temperatures Using Arrays and Loops**

**Exercise 1: Difficulty: Medium**

**Objective:** 
Write a program that processes an array of daily temperatures for one week and performs specific analyses and manipulations using loops.

**Task:**
1. **Initialize an Array**: 
   - Create an array called `weeklyTemperatures` that holds the average daily temperatures for a week. For example, `[68, 70, 75, 72, 69, 74, 73]`.

2. **Calculate Average Temperature**:
   - Use a loop to traverse the array and calculate the average temperature of the week. Print the result in the format: "The average temperature for the week is X degrees."

3. **Identify Temperature Trends**:
   - Implement a loop to identify and print "Increasing trend" if a temperature is higher than the previous day's temperature, "Decreasing trend" if it's lower, or "Constant" if it remains the same. Display the result for each day, starting from the second day up to the last.

4. **Detect and Print Extremes**:
   - Find and print the highest and lowest temperatures of the week using a loop. Format the output as: "The highest temperature was X degrees, and the lowest was Y degrees."

5. **Heatwave Detection**:
   - Define a "heatwave" as any three or more consecutive days where temperatures are above 70 degrees. Use a loop to detect if there is a heatwave within the array and print a message such as "Heatwave detected!" or "No heatwave detected." based on the findings.

6. **Adjust Temperatures**:
   - Assume there was a calibration error and each recorded temperature was 2 degrees too high. Write a loop to adjust the `weeklyTemperatures` array by reducing each temperature by 2 degrees. Print the adjusted array of temperatures.

By accomplishing this task, you will gain practical experience in using loops for array operations, performing calculations and comparisons, and developing logic to address specific problems in a structured manner.
